## Variables
PSR does not currently have recommendations for what style to write variables in, should a recommendation become available we will adapt to that standard.

For now, we ask that contributors write variables in PascalCase.

For example: $Variable or $MyVariable

Of course, plugins, themes, and extensions made by other people are not expected to follow our guides, it's your own software - do what you want!
But anything in Saturn's core (including the official Control Panel plugin) should follow these guidelines.
