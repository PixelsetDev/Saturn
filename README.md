# Saturn
Saturn is a content management system for publishers, educators, and everyone in-between. It's lightweight, blazing-fast, and incredibly powerful.

## Contributing
This branch '1.0.0-dev' is still being planned. Please don't add any major features without emailing contact@lewismilburn.com to discuss. You're more than welcome to improve existing code.

The branch 'main' holds the old BETA code, if you'd like you can update this, but we're no longer releasing new versions.
