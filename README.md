> ⚠️ The current version of Saturn is unstable and likely to have bugs. If you use it in a production environment you should backup your website regularly. I'm working on a new version of Saturn that will be much more stable and have new features. ETA late 2023 or early 2024.

## Early Access
Saturn is in early access BETA, it's highly likely that you'll find bugs. We don't recommend it's use in production environments.

## How does Saturn display pages?
Saturn uses the Saturn Router and Render Engine to show pages, meaning that we don't need to hard-code any frontend of your website. The Saturn router is fast and powerful, it allows us to save space and complexity by serving all your public-facing webpages from only two files! It handles rendering, themeing, errors and more.
