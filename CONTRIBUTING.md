# Welcome to Saturn contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

  See the [README](README.md) to get an overview of the project. Here are some helpful resources to get you comfortable with open source contribution:
  If you're programming with us, please see the [STYLEGUIDE](STYLEGUIDE.md).
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with Saturn, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/lmwnweb/saturn/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/lmwnweb/saturn/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

- GitHub Codespaces:
  - [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

3. Install the latest version of PHP. For more information, see [the readme](readme.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Once you are ready with your changes, don't forget to self review to quicken the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're done making the changes, open a pull request, often referred to as a PR.
- Fill out the "Ready for review" template so we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
